Practice C#
Puzzle solver
Here I learnt how to use NAMESPACES to factorize names.
A puzzle is a namespace, where we can found only 4 classes
* Input and State data classes
* Solutions classes with all methods used to solve to puzzle
* A Parser class to parse the text input of the puzzle.

Using a good naming convention, creating a new Blazor page is just a matter of cut and paste en change the namespace.
A use of reflexion allows to get the page title and methods names dynamically.
