    This is a Sudoku solver, and it has really no relation with Advent Of Code !

<p class="p-1">
    All empty cells are adorned with the count of potential numbers.
    When the count of potential numbers is greater than 1, we should make a guess and explore until an inconsistency arises (colored in red).
    The visualization displays a guessed number in blue.
    The number of dots under the numbers indicates the depth of the search.
